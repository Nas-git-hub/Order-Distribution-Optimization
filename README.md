# Order-Distribution-Optimization
An e-commerce company, based in Lome, Togo, serves customers in Ghana through multiple delivery centres. However, they faced order distribution inefficiencies, leading to:
•	Uneven truck utilization: Some trucks were overloaded while others traveled nearly empty.
•	High pending orders: Large backlog.
•	Slow logistic process: Due to inefficient truck assignments.
To solve these problems, I conducted data analysis, optimization, and visualization to improve our logistics operations.
